You may think I'm crazy. 'A mad man,' you say. Wrong, you fool. I'm not a mad man. Yes, it may sound similar to your foolish ears. You may find it amusing even. But it will not become the truth. No truth can arise by your whim. By no one's whim it can. Mine, of course, excepted. But I am the amendment. The amendment to the constituion. The Constitution of the Universe. 'Everything is a lie,' says the Constitution. Amendment! I am the truth! 'All dies,' says the Constitution. Amendment! I am immortal. You fool. I know what you think of me. I feel you despise me.
