Then was the time of yore 
When we were lonely there, 
When we were the only ones 
To boldly watch. 

He told me to be wary, 
Scared of anything godly 
I was. No meaning was 
Immediately available. 

Out in the open fields 
I saw something 
Standing on its tail 
Like you never did. 

Eyes hurting. Were men. 
Were wolves. Were is man. 
Pour moi, pour tout le monde. 
Nothing will ever be 
Seen again by those eyes. 
Never again.
